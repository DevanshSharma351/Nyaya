# Nyaya — Engineering Log

A running record of **what was built, and why**. Entries are append-only and
dated. Where a decision had a plausible alternative, the alternative and the
reason for rejecting it are recorded, so that the reasoning can be audited later
rather than reconstructed from memory.

This document is the narrative counterpart to `docs/adr/`, which holds the
formal single-decision records.

## 2026-09-04 — Session 1: Problem framing and foundation

### Starting point

The brief (`Problem Statement.docx`) specifies an agentic LLM system for
requirements engineering in the financial sector: 20 numbered sections, a
13-agent architecture, a regulatory knowledge base, and 12 evaluation metrics.

**First judgement call: the brief is a specification of ambition, not a build
order.** Implementing all 13 agents shallowly — one prompt each — produces a
system that demos as an LLM wrapper and cannot be evaluated meaningfully. The
brief itself points the other way in §18: *"Begin with one financial use case."*

The chosen strategy is therefore **depth in one vertical slice, with a real
evaluation harness**, rather than breadth across all named capabilities.

### Decision 1 — Primary domain: digital onboarding / eKYC

| Considered | Outcome |
|---|---|
| **eKYC / customer onboarding** | **Selected** |
| Loan origination | Retained as the *secondary* domain, used only to test generalization |
| Payments / UPI | Rejected |
| Fraud detection | Rejected |

Reasoning:

1. **The corpus is clause-numbered.** RBI Master Direction on KYC, FATF
   Recommendations, GDPR, DPDP Act 2023 and PMLA rules are public *and*
   structured as numbered clauses. This is the decisive factor: span-level
   citation and a measurable citation-correctness metric are only possible when
   the source has stable, addressable units. PCI-DSS (payments) is licensed and
   less cleanly addressable.
2. **Stakeholder conflict is genuine, not synthetic.** Growth wants minimal
   signup friction; compliance wants document verification; security wants
   liveness detection and device binding; operations wants manual review queues.
   The conflict-detection agent has real contradictions to find.
3. **PII is intrinsic.** Identity documents and biometrics mean the masking
   layer is load-bearing rather than decorative.
4. **The SDLC answer is non-obvious.** Heavily regulated *and* subject to
   frequent UX change — exactly the case where a single-label recommendation is
   wrong and a ranked one is informative.

### Decision 2 — Seven differentiators over a baseline LLM wrapper

Recorded here because they define what "finished" means:

1. **Benchmark against public gold sets** (PROMISE NFR, PURE), not only
   self-authored demos. Highest-leverage single item: it makes results
   comparable to published literature.
2. **Calibrated confidence** — fused from retrieval score, NLI entailment,
   self-consistency across *k* samples, and rule-validator outcome. *Not* model
   self-report, which is known to be poorly calibrated. Reported as a reliability
   diagram and Expected Calibration Error.
3. **Deterministic validator behind every LLM compliance claim** — the cited
   clause must exist verbatim in the versioned KB, must entail the control, and
   mandatory-control coverage must be complete.
4. **Regulatory-change impact analysis** — amending a clause walks the
   traceability graph and reports which requirements are now stale.
5. **SDLC selection by MCDA** — AHP weights (with consistency-ratio check) plus
   TOPSIS ranking. The mathematics ranks; the LLM only explains.
6. **Hash-chained append-only audit ledger.**
7. **Adversarial hardening** — prompt-injection defence demonstrated against a
   poisoned policy document.

Plus an **ablation study** (no-RAG / RAG / RAG+validator; single-agent /
multi-agent) to show the architecture earns its complexity.

### Decision 3 — Collapse 13 agents into 9 nodes

The brief's 13 agents are a *taxonomy*, not a design. Several are a single
prompt; several should not be LLMs at all. The system is modelled as a stateful
graph with typed state and explicit interrupt points.

**Governing principle: determinism wherever determinism is possible.** Quality
linting, conflict clustering, MCDA ranking and approval gating are deterministic;
the LLM is used only where judgement is genuinely required. This is what makes
outputs reproducible, cheap, and auditable — and is itself a finding worth
reporting.

### Decision 4 — Technology stack

| Layer | Choice | Why this and not the obvious alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | **LangGraph** | Not CrewAI/AutoGen. Those optimise for autonomous agent-to-agent negotiation, which is a *liability* in a regulated, auditable workflow. LangGraph gives an explicit state machine with checkpointing and **interrupts** — interrupts are precisely the human-approval primitive the brief demands, and the checkpoint history supplies much of the audit trail for free. |
| Datastore | **PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector**, single DB | Not a separate Qdrant/Chroma. One store gives transactional consistency between a requirement row and its evidence rows, one backup and access-control story, and is what a bank would actually approve. |
| Retrieval | Dense (pgvector) + lexical (`tsvector`) fused by **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**, then cross-encoder rerank | On clause-structured legal text, hybrid + rerank is a large and *measurable* precision gain over naive dense retrieval. Citation precision is a headline metric, so this is not premature optimisation. |
| Rule engine | **YAML DSL + own evaluator** | Not Drools. Rules live in git, are diffable and versioned, and the explanation trace is fully controlled. Better auditability story than a black box, at ~300 lines. |
| Backend | FastAPI + Pydantic | Pydantic models double as the schema-forcing contract for LLM structured output. |
| Privacy | Microsoft Presidio + reversible token vault | Masking happens *before* egress; rehydration only after approval. |
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + React Flow | React Flow for the traceability graph. |
| Auth | Keycloak (OIDC, RBAC, MFA) | Realistic for the domain; cheap in Docker. |

### Decision 5 — Model strategy: hybrid, zero-cost, provider-agnostic

Constraint from the user: **no paid API for now, possibly later.**
Hardware: Apple M3 Pro, 18 GB unified memory, 11 cores.

Resolution — assign models to a **role**, never to a vendor:

| Role | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `embedding` | `ollama:bge-m3` (1.2 GB, 1024-dim) | Local, no egress, free. Verified working. |
| `fast` | `ollama:llama3.1:8b` | High-volume classification and routing. |
| `reasoning` | `ollama:qwen3:8b` | Fits comfortably in 18 GB alongside Docker. |

Hosted free tiers (**Gemini** primary — its very large context suits long
regulatory PDFs; **Groq** fallback) and **Claude** are implemented but unused by
default. Switching is a one-line `.env` change, because `ModelRole` →
`ModelSpec` resolution happens in `nyaya/config.py` and agents never name a
vendor.

**Deliberate consequence:** the eval harness can swap models between arms of an
ablation without touching agent code, which is what makes a model-comparison
study cheap to run.

### Decision 6 — Project name

Originally scaffolded as `aegis` (a codename chosen without consultation).
Renamed to **Nyaya** (न्याय) at the user's direction — the Indian school of logic
concerned with *pramāṇa*, the valid means of acquiring knowledge and what counts
as admissible evidence for a claim. This is an unusually exact fit: the system's
central mechanism is evidence-grounded claims carrying citations and calibrated
confidence. Renamed while the cost was 3 files rather than 40.

### Built in this session

- Repository layout, `uv`-managed environment pinned to **Python 3.12**
  (the machine's system Python is 3.14, which is ahead of PyTorch and
  sentence-transformers wheel availability).
- `docker-compose.yml`: Postgres 17 + pgvector, MinIO, Keycloak (behind a
  `full` profile so the default `up` stays light).
- `nyaya/config.py` — role-based model routing; every tunable sourced from env.
- `nyaya/llm/` — provider-agnostic interface plus adapters for Ollama, Gemini,
  Groq, Anthropic, and a deterministic `echo` double for tests and the eval
  control arm.
- `nyaya/core/enums.py` — closed controlled vocabularies (13 requirement
  categories, 7 SDLC models, 10 defect types). Closed sets are what make
  downstream aggregation and metrics well-defined.

**Verified, not assumed:**
- pgvector 0.8.6, pg_trgm, uuid-ossp all live; `default_text_search_config` set
  to `english` so generated `tsvector` columns resolve identically everywhere.
- All three model roles reachable; `bge-m3` returns 1024-dim vectors;
  schema-constrained decoding genuinely enforces the Pydantic shape (verified by
  round-tripping a `Requirement` model through Ollama's `format` parameter).
- `ruff check` clean.

### Incident — home directory is a git repository

`/Users/devanshsharma/.git` exists with zero commits, making the entire home
folder a repo. A `git add -A` issued from the project directory therefore
targeted all of `~` and hung.

- **Effect:** cleared 22 stale index entries for `~/github/OS-Project/` — files
  already deleted from disk before this session. That directory no longer exists.
- **Recoverability:** 136 loose objects (~9.7 MB) remain in `~/.git/objects`,
  reachable via `git fsck --lost-found`. Nothing was in history; that repo has no
  commits.
- **Fix applied:** the project was given its own repository, isolated from `~`.
- **Outstanding, for the user to decide:** whether to delete `~/.git`. Left in
  place deliberately — removing it is destructive and not the assistant's call.
  Recommended, since an accidental `git add -A` there could stage SSH and cloud
  credentials.

### Next

1. SQLAlchemy models + Alembic migration: requirements, evidence, clauses,
   traceability edges, audit ledger.
2. Ingestion pipeline with clause-aware chunking and the PII shield.
3. **The retrieval spine, evaluated in isolation before any agent exists** —
   everything downstream inherits its ceiling, so it is measured first.
